<a id="description">A unoffical client for Imgur. Known Issues:
     - If a media is played through the STMC ( System Media Transport Controls) in a page with multiple medias the App will crash.
     - Go-back using the Navigation Bar can result in a erratic behavior after app suspended (Close Popup shows even if its not the first page).</a>
